                <p>I had different carrier path since i started working. First i pursue a carrier in hospitality. Studied in France hospitality as well as someliere. I went travelling as working in my field. 8 years later i end it up in Canada in the midlle of a pandemic, which led me to do a change of carrier. I am currently working as head of department in a clothing DC. But still looking for the field that will fullfill my expectation i started to learn coding. </p></td>
